## 8. LSP vs Text Search Comparison

**Prompt:** Create a split comparison infographic: "grep vs LSP" for code intelligence. Left side (grep - red tint): scattered text matches, broken connections, question marks, showing chaos. Right side (LSP - green tint): organized code tree, precise arrows to definitions, type annotations visible, clean connections. Center dividing line with "vs". Include small comparison table at bottom: Find Definition, Find References, Rename Symbol, Type Info. Modern developer-focused design.

---

## 9. Context Management Best Practices

**Prompt:** Illustrate context management for AI coding sessions. Show two approaches: Top (bad): one overflowing container with mixed colors representing polluted context, compaction warning sign. Bottom (good): multiple clean, separate containers - one for "Research", one for "Implementation", connected to subagent boxes that handle searches. Use visual metaphor of clean vs cluttered workspaces. Modern minimalist style with red/green indicators.

---

## 10. Local vs Cloud LLM Decision Matrix

**Prompt:** Create a decision flowchart diagram comparing Local vs Cloud LLMs. Two columns: LOCAL (laptop icon) with items: Sensitive Data, High Volume, Offline Required, Cost Optimization. CLOUD (cloud icon) with items: Max Quality Needed, Sporadic Usage, Frontier Capabilities, Complex Reasoning. Use connecting decision diamonds in the middle. Modern infographic style with blue/purple gradient. Include small hardware specs at bottom of local column.

---

## 11. Agent Memory Architecture

**Prompt:** Create a technical architecture diagram showing AI Agent Memory system. Central brain icon connected to: Transcript Storage (external folder), Vector Index (SQLite database cylinder), Summarization Engine (labeled "Haiku - fast model"), Semantic Search (magnifying glass with vectors). Show data flow: conversations → stored → indexed → retrieved. Dark tech aesthetic with glowing neural network connections. Clean labels and modern iconography.

## Usage Notes

- **Gemini**: Works well with detailed, descriptive prompts. Add "digital art style" or "infographic style" for best results.
- **OpenAI DALL-E**: Prefers concise prompts. May need to simplify longer prompts above.
- **Midjourney**: Add style suffixes like `--style raw` or `--v 6` for technical diagrams.

For all prompts, consider adding:
- "No text labels" if you want to add text yourself
- "White background" for documentation use
- "16:9 aspect ratio" for presentations
- "Vector style" for scalable graphics
