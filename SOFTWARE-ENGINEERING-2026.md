# Software Engineering in 2026

Are you already behind? Probably! Let's fix that.

## Core Principles

 - AI should be writing the code
 - AI should be reading the code to validate work
 - AI should be more than just code, your docs, specs, presentations

## Local LLMS
TODO fill out
 - GPT OSS
 - Kimi K2
 - MiniMax
 - DeepSeek

## You Engineering Experties is needed more than ever
Now that the typing and manual clicking on your computer is mostly solved by AI, your role as an engineer is shifting.

### Director of Agents
Our work as engineers and architects now is much harder - we need to pay extra care for architecture, planning, testing, verifying, making sure we stand to KPIs
and then provide approvals as a Director of Agents 😀
also it's useful to use a proper GU8 diff viewer to let code suggest edits

## Taking a break is way easier now
 - submit prompt, take a break!
 - TODO add more
 - allows you to remain productive even when tired

## AI make Visualizations
 - ask AI to draw diagrams of architecture
 - Generative diagrams of workflows
 - Gemini flash 3 draw full pictures

## Workflow using Generative Coding

Each of the following are separate prompts in a workflow:

 - Prompt AI to 
 - Review Code to ensure that it actually impemented



## Prompting Guidlines
- intent
- goal
- simple

## Beyond just AI

 - Using 🦀 Rust for all new code
     - clippy fmt audit
 - More Rustdoc tripple slashes
 - Strong type checking
 - With Python use type checkers like mypy

## Yes it's Already Starting

Claude Code is already 100% being written by Claude Code.
Anthropic has openly stated that they are using 100% of AI to write their codebase.
Yes it is scary.
Anthropic used Claude with a profiler to fix a memory leak in claude code
The skynet scenario is closer than you think.
Well maybe not the distopian skynet scenario, but definitely a world where AI is writing and validating code.
We are appriaching the 2028 Singularity faster than you think.

## Beyond COde Generation
 - Write docs and specs
 - Make your presentations for you

It won't get everying 100% correct on the first pass.
Keep prompting to improve to hit your target goal.

## 
like having scripts that you can run to get traces profilers debugers on the product is so useful

## Ask AI to Use Tools
 - Use linters
 - Use type checkers
 - Use test runners
 - Use Profilers

## AI Validation "reading"

- Security review
- Smoke testing
- Stress testing
- Code reduction
- Test coverage
- Documentation
- Dead code removal (Housekeeping)
- 12 Factor coverage
- Observability coverage

## TDD and Unit Testing with AI

 - TODO fill 


## Vibe Coding vs Professional SE-Focused Generative Coding

### Vibe Coding
Submits prompts with large brush strokes:
- "Build this feature XYZ"
- "Fix this bug:" *pasted error stack trace*

### SE-Focused Generative Coding
- Minimize errors by focusing on small tasks
- Ask AI to refactor and reduce code
- More deliberate and structured approach
- Example: "Create a function that takes these inputs and produces this output"
- Example: "Refactor this function to improve readability and reduce complexity"
- Test driven development with AI "common well defined processes that have been proven to work well"

## AI Agents written by AI Agents "Claude Code"

You can write an AI agent that writes other AI agents.
This is how Claude Code is built as mentioned above.


## Different AI Models and Tools

- Brokk / Claude Code / Codex / Gemini / etc.

## More Than Just Coding

- Tasklet
- AI writes tests
- Code review by human and AI
- You should still skim code changes
- Use AI to help you define specs

## Key Concepts

### RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
AI models enhanced by retrieving relevant context from external sources (codebase, docs, databases) before generating responses. This allows AI to work with up-to-date, project-specific information rather than relying solely on training data.

## New Skills to Master

Skills in 2026 that go beyond traditional programming:

- Agents and subagents
- Prompting
- Context management
- RAG patterns and embeddings
- CLI modes
- Tools and plugins
- Skills and hooks
- MCP (Model Context Protocol)
- LSP (Language Server Protocol)
- Slash commands
- Workflows
- IDE integrations

## Useful MCPs

- GitHub
- Jira (Atlassian)
- Confluence (Atlassian)

## Resources

- [Spec Driven Development - GitHub Spec Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit)


## Fringe AI with AI powered Operations
 - remeidation like pod restart
 - scaling
 - log triage
 - rollback
