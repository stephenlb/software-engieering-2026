Are you already behind? Probably! Let's fix that.

 - AI should be writing the code 
 - AI should be reading the code "validate work."

## AI Validation
 - Security review
 - Code reduction
 - Test coverage
 - Documentation
 - Dead code removale "Housekeeping"
 - 12 Factor coverage

## Differnece beetween Vibe Coding and SE focused Generative Coding

 - Vibe coding submits promts with large brush strokes.
   - For example: "Build this feature XYZ"
   - Fix this bug: "pasted error stack trace"

 - SE focused Generative Code
  - 



Tips:
 - Minimize errors by focusing on small tasks. 
 - Ask AI to refactor and reduce code.

## Data Points

 - Claude Code is already 100% being written by Claude Code


## List of MCPs
 - GitHub
 - Jira "Atlassian"
 - Confluence "Atlassian"


More than just coding:

- Brokk/Claude Code/Codex/Gemini/etc
- Tasklet
- AI write tests
- Code Review by human and AI
- You should still skim code changes
- Use AI to help you define specs

New mastery:
agents, subagents, prompting, context, cli-modes, tools, plugins, skills, hooks, MCP, LSP, slash commands, workflows, IDE integrations
